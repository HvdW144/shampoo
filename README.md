# Welcome to the official SHAMPOO GitHub repository
SHAMPOO (**S**toc**HA**stic **M**onomer **P**r**O**cess**O**r) is a model simulating the evolution of individual dust particles in a stochastic fashion, faciliating a Monte-Carlo-like approach towards dust evolution in protoplanetary disks.

# Getting started: Individual monomers
