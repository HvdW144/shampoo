# Welcome to the SHAMPOO GitHub repository
SHAMPOO (**S**toc**HA**stic **M**onomer **P**r**O**cess**O**r) is a model simulating the evolution of individual dust particles in a stochastic fashion, faciliating a Monte-Carlo-like approach towards dust evolution in protoplanetary disks.

# Introduction
Over the past years, many modelling efforts have explored the effects of dynamical, collisional and ice processing on dust in planet-forming disks. In this context, SHAMPOO provides a framework to explore the effects of these three processes combined on an individual dust particle in a disk that remains both physically and chemically static over the duration of the simulation. SHAMPOO is therefore aimed towards providing a complete description of these processes on the properties of dust particles in the planet-forming region on timescales shorter than 100 000 yr.
